This is the place holder folder where I would extract Sailpoint IIQ SSD files from https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/Professional-Services/Services-Standard-Deployment-SSD-v7/ta-p/190497 
You can also populate ./base/ga and ./base/patch from https://community.sailpoint.com/t5/IdentityIQ-Server-Software/ct-p/IdentityIQ
